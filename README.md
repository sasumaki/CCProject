# Artificial Painter
Mini-project for Computational Creativity course in University of Helsinki.

The main goal is to create novel art with Generative Adversarial Network. It uses a corpus of images to train the neural network to generate "human-like" art.

To run the code please clone the repository and follow the instructions in installation.txt


Based on adversarial models cloned from https://github.com/bstriner/keras-adversarial.git

Images for training are from Web Gallery of Art https://www.wga.hu/
